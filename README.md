## Android

add this to your AndroidManifest.xml

```dart
 <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW" />

 <application>
        ...
        <service
           android:name="com.requiemz.overlay_pop_up.OverlayService"
           android:exported="false" />
    </application>
```

### Android 14

applications that target SDK 34 and use foreground service should include foregroundServiceType attribute([see documentation](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/14/changes/fgs-types-required)).

```dart
 <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW" />

 <application>
        ...
        <service
           android:name="com.requiemz.overlay_pop_up.OverlayService"
           android:exported="false"
           <!-- add this -->
           android:foregroundServiceType="camera, dataSync, location, etc" />
    </application>
```

## Flutter implementation

configure your main.dart entry point a widget to display (make sure to add @pragma('vm:entry-point'))

**NOTE:**
Now you can pass as parameter the dart entry point method name when showOverlay is called

```dart
@pragma("vm:entry-point")
void overlayPopUp() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  runApp(const MaterialApp(
    debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
    home: Text('Hello Pub.dev!'),
  ));
}
```

## Overlay Methods

  returns true when overlay permission is alreary granted if permission is not granted then open app settings

  ```dart
  await OverlayPopUp.requestPermission();
  ```

  returns true or false according to permission status

  ```dart
  await OverlayPopUp.checkPermission();
  ```

  display your overlay and return true if is showed
